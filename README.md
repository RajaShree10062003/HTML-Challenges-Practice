# HTML-Challenges-Practice
In this repository there contains many different files demonstrating the works done with HTML and CSS.
Each and every file's description has been shared below.

**Flipping_Cards_HTML_CSS:**
  * This code creates a visually engaging webpage featuring interactive flip cards with personalized fortune messages. Each card has a front image and a back side with a unique background, colorful gradients, or gifs, which flips to reveal an inspiring message when hovered over.
  * The page uses CSS flexbox to center and space out the cards, while 3D transformations enable the flip effect. A fixed header with a glowing text effect stays at the top, and a small animated parrot icon decorates the bottom-left corner, adding a playful touch.
  * The design combines custom fonts, gradients, and animations to create an uplifting and dynamic user experience.

**Mirror_Effect_buttons_HTML_CSS:**
  * This code creates a webpage with three neon-styled buttons that glow in different colors (lime, pink, and cyan) when idle, and change appearance on hover.
  * On hover, each buttonâ€™s background color matches its neon border, the text changes to black, and a shadow effect is added for a stronger glow.
  * This design gives a dynamic, retro aesthetic to the buttons, suitable for dark-themed interfaces or gaming sites.

**Navigation_Menus_HTML_CSS:**
  * This code sets up a vertical sidebar menu with a steel blue background, rounded borders, and white text.
  * On hover, li items have a background color change to white, and the text color switches to steel blue. A rounded effect is applied to the top-left and bottom-left corners.

**Profile_cards_HTML_CSS:**
  * This code creates a black-themed, three-column profile card layout with a gradient background and hover effects. Each profile card (`.child` class) has a unique gradient, rounded corners, a shadow effect on hover, and contains an image, name, title, and description for the individual.
  * The card also includes social media icons with low opacity that brighten on hover. CSS `flex` layout is used for alignment within the `.parent` container, centering each card horizontally and vertically within the page.
  * The Font Awesome library is used to display icons for each social media link.

**Silver_Effect_Game_Cards_HTML_CSS:**
  * This code creates an image gallery with a stylish silver hover effect. Each image has a black background, rounded corners, and, on hover, displays a silver gradient overlay and a subtle shadow. This effect gives the images a polished, metallic look, enhancing visual appeal.
  * The CSS box-shadow and linear-gradient properties create the hover effect, which combines a shadow and a gradient overlay to mimic a reflective surface.
  * Each image has consistent dimensions for a uniform appearance in the gallery.

**Wall_Clipped_Cards_HTML_CSS:**
  * This code creates a layout with four distinct sections, each containing a quote from a famous personality, styled with a gradient background and box shadow effects.
  * Each section is positioned absolutely within the parent container, giving it a floating appearance. The :hover effect on each section changes the background to a GIF, enhancing the interactive feel.
  * Images representing the personalities are displayed next to the quotes, and the layout is designed to be visually appealing with color and shadow contrasts. Each section is uniquely colored and positioned to create a dynamic design.

**Polaroid_Cards_HTML_CSS:**
Here comes the favourite challenge of mine,
  * This code creates a dynamic layout of animated "Polaroid" cards with rotating images and captions, simulating a floating effect. Each card contains a GIF image and a caption, which animates in a zigzag pattern using CSS keyframes to move and rotate.
  * The cards are positioned using absolute values within a container, and a hover effect is applied to increase the size and z-index, making the cards more interactive. The background of the page features a repeating water-themed GIF, adding to the overall playful, animated design.
  * The cards create an engaging visual experience through rotation and movement.
